/* 
Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion.
 They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself.
 Any of the eight data types may be stored in a variable.
 Variables are similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, 
 which means they're a simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. 
 Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different 
 values at different times.
